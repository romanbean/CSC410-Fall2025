The synchronization technique of using pthread_join will work correctly to ensure that the main thread waits for each worker thread to finish before proceeding. This is because pthread_join suspends the calling thread (usually the main thread) until the specified target thread terminates, guaranteeing that all threads complete their computation before results are combined or further processing is done. However, pthread_join only synchronizes on thread terminationâ€”it does not provide mutual exclusion or coordinate threads during execution. Therefore, this technique works well when threads operate on separate data partitions and no shared data is modified concurrently. If threads needed to coordinate intermediate steps or access shared resources, other synchronization primitives like mutexes or condition variables would be required to avoid race conditions and ensure correct sequencing.
