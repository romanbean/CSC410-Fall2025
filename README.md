<h1>Parallel Computing - CSC410 @ Dakota State University</h1>

- A1 - Starting with Sequential
- - An assignment where we wrote sequential programs, sum of arrays, the Queens game, bubble and merge sort algorithms, and numerical integration. Wrote a bash script to time all programs at once. Will parallelize in the next assigment.
